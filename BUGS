Header: mkinitramfs-ll/BUGS, 2014/10/02

---
/etc/mdev.conf:
    group name should replaced by group id (gid) because there is no `/etc/group'
	file bundled in the initramfs.
---
/etc/mtab:
    this file should be readable, or else a `/mtab' whould be created.
---
die (helper):
   die() does not work properly in a script/module (rsh is ignored all together).
___
squashdir-mount.initd:
    this init service cannot manage mounting in time with newer >=udev-182, so
    some depend() hacks were added, still system directories should listed first
    especially `usr'.
___
echo:
    echo-ing return values is problematic, this should be minimized or replaced
    by global variables.
