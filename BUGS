Header: mkinitramfs-ll/BUGS, 2015/01/20

---
rescue shell (rsh):
    Sometimes exit-ing in a rescue shell does not work, init will be stuck in
	place. In this case *do not* exit a second or a kernel panic await. It's
	better to unmount everything, close dm-crypt cyphertext and reboot.
---
/etc/mdev.conf:
    uid:gid should be use instead of user:group, or else, expect failure.
---
/etc/mtab:
    this file should be readable, or else a `/mtab' whould be created.
---
die (helper):
   die() does not work properly in a script/module (rsh is ignored all together).
   So helper alternative (in LIBDIR/helpers) is available that will properly exit.
___
squashdir.initd:
    this init service cannot manage mounting in time with newer >=udev-182, so
    some depend() hacks were added, still system directories should listed first
    especially `usr'.
___
echo:
    echo-ing return values is problematic, this should be minimized or replaced
    by global variables.
___
swsusp:
    *resume=device resume_offset=value* are required when resuming from a file
    with swsusp (default implementation if not using a TuxOnIce patched kernel).
    Beware that a plain partition is necessary, or else, resuming will fails.
    (The issue is there is no delay nor a sysfs file to echo the offset value.)
