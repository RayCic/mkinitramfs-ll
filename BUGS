Header: mkinitramfs-ll/BUGS, 2014/09/30

---
kernel module search:
    Kernel module should be properly listed in mkinitramfs-ll.conf or passed
	to building script with a regular expression name.
	zsh script will match <module-name>(|-*) and bash only <module-name>.
	There is no way the same could be done for bash script because searching
	is done with finduitils. So an extensive list is required for bash script
	because *<module-name>* match to many module for e.g. video.
---
/etc/mtab:
    this file should be readable, or else a `/mtab' whould be created.
---
die (helper):
   die() does not work properly in a script/module (rsh is ignored all together).
___
squashdir-mount.initd:
    this init service cannot manage mounting in time with newer >=udev-182, so
    some depend() hacks were added, still system directories should listed first
    especially `usr'.
___
echo:
    echo-ing return values is problematic, this should be minimized or replaced
    by global variables.
