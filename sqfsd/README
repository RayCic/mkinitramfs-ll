Need dependancies is not mandatory, if and only if, lib$ARCH and usr are mounted in a initramfs, 
otherwise you might run into big troubles for two reasons: 
	* rc uses a tmpfs mounted on /lib$ARCH/rc/init.d to store states of running services and 
	* many services need binaries/libraries from usr when booting up.

Actually, without an initramfs you one get aufs+squashfs working without an issue if you ensure: 
usr and lib64 get mounted as earlier as possible with/without localmount help. This initservice 
will do the trick putting usr and lib64 first in the config file because a few (boot) services 
are russ=hing on each other (especially with rc_parallel) to get userspace ready. 
Additionaly, you could disable rc_parallel and add more services in the `before' line if need be.

NOTE on `/etc/con.d/sqfsdmount' configuration variables:
	* SYS|LOCAL is a sufix for system/local which speaks of itself, one should to put squashed 
	  dirs related to system in SFQD_SYS, e.g. /usr:/sbin:/bin:/opt, and local ones in the other 
	  as $SQFSD_LOCAL dirs will be unmounted right way when a the init service is stopped which.
	* SQFSDIR is the root directory where .sfs images and mount points for aufs rw/ro branches.
