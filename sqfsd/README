Need dependancies is not mandatory, if and only if, lib64 and usr are mounted in a initramfs, 
otherwise you might run into big troubles for two reasons: 
	* rc uses a tmpfs mounted on /lib64/rc/init.d to store states of running services and 
	* many services need binaries/libraries from usr in the boot up. 
Actually, without an initramfs you could get aufs+squashfs working without an issue if you ensure: 
usr and lib64 get mounted as earlier as possible with/without localmount help. This initservice 
will do the trick putting usr and lib64 first in the config file. Additionaly, you could disable 
rc_parallel and add more services in the `before' line if need be.
