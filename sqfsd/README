Need dependancies is not mandatory, if and only if, lib64 and usr are mounted in a initramfs, 
otherwise you might run into big troubles for two reasons: 
	* rc uses a tmpfs mounted on /lib64/rc/init.d to store states of running services and 
	* many services need binaries/libraries from usr in the boot up. 
Actually, without an initramfs you could get aufs+squashfs working without an issue if you ensure: 
usr and lib64 get mounted as earlier as possible with/without localmount help. This initservice 
will do the trick putting usr and lib64 first in the config file. Additionaly, you could disable 
rc_parallel and add more services in the `before' line if need be.

NOTE on `/etc/con.d/sqfsdmount' configuration variables:
	* the first letter S|L is a prefix for S[system] L[local] which speaks of itself: one has to
	to put squashed dirs related to system in SSFQD, e.g. usr, and local ones in LSQFSD as the 
	ones in LSQFSD will be unmounted right way when a the init service `/etc/init.d:sqfsdmount' is 
	stopped which will happen for a reboot for example.
	* SQFSDIR is the root directory where .sfs images and mount points are; and SQFSD is for
	the squashed directry(ies), it's a `:' colon seperated list without the leading `/' slash.
