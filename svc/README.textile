* squashdir-mount.initd:

Actually, without an initramfs one can get AUFS+squashfs working without an
issue if you make sure '/usr' and '/$abi_libdir' get mounted as earlier as
possible with or without localmount help.

This init service will do the trick putting '/usr' and @/$abi_libdir@ first
in the config file because a few (boot) services are rushing
(especially with rc_parallel) to get userspace ready. 

* sdr.$shell:

a script to use in conjonction with sqfsdmount to *squash* directories
and it now uses lzo as default compressor for efficiency/speed, one can use
'lzo -Xcompression-level 6' for better compression ratio.

*Warning*: lz4 implementation is not implemented to squashfs yet!

* sdr.$shell/squashdir-mount.initd: both script use '/aufs' as default location.

*Warning*: sdr.$shell now should works when updating system dirs, it needs
a copy of a @static busybox@ to @/tmp/busybox@ to function properly.

* zram.init.d:

zram init service can initialize, if not done with the included initramfs, and
set up a few zram devices to use (for swap {/var,}/tmp).

*Note*: Read the configuration file for the differents config variables.
