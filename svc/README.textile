* squashdir-mount.initd:

Actually, without an initramfs one can get AUFS+squashfs working without an
issue if you make sure '/usr' and '/$abi_libdir' get mounted as earlier as
possible with or without localmount help.

This init service will do the trick putting '/usr' and @/$abi_libdir@ first
in the config file because a few (boot) services are rushing
(especially with rc_parallel) to get userspace ready. 

* sdr.$shell: a script to use in conjonction with sqfsdmount to *squash* dirs
* and it now uses lz4 as default compressor for efficiency/speed, one can use
'lzo -Xcompression-level 1' for similar performance if you don't have lz4
(you should have it already as system dependency).
* sdr.$shell and squashdir-mount.initd now use '/var/aufs' as default location

*Warn*: sdr.$shell now should works when updating system dirs, it needs
to copy @$(which bb)@ or a static busybox to @/tmp/busybox@ to function properly.

* zram.init.d:

zram init service can initialize, if not done with the included initramfs, and
set up a few zram devices to use (for swap {/var,}/tmp).

*Note*: Read the configuration file for the differents config variables.
