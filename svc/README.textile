Actually, without an initramfs one can get aufs+squashfs working without an
issue if you make sure @/usr@ and @/lib${arch}@ get mounted as earlier as
possible with or without localmount help.

This init service will do the trick putting @/usr@ and @/lib${arch}@ first
in the config file because a few (boot) services are rushing
(especially with rc_parallel) to get userspace ready. 

*Note*: Remain a singe consideration >=sys-apps/openrc-0.10 which moved
@/lib/rc/init.d@ to @/run/openrc@.

*Note*: Read the configuration file for the differents config variables.

*Warn*: sdr.$shell now should works when updating system dirs, it needs
to copy @$(which bb)@  or a static busybox to @/tmp/busybox@ to work properly.
