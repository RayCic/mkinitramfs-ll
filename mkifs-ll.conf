# Most the bellow paramaters are collon seperated list (somewhat arrays) meaning
# one can append more than one font, splash, keymap and of course binary-ies and 
# kernel modules!
#
# Array of module groups, modules are separated by collon ':' in a group;
# nls_cp437:vfat should be putted to remdev group for vfat remdev users; if built 
# as modules the script will include them and nothing if not so one can leave as 
# is or remove/add a few names; the same goes for MOD[ule]DEP[ependency] variable.
