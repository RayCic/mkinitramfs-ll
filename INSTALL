To install this package and actually make any use of it, you will need at least
a shell, bash or zsh at your choice. Zsh scripts are shorter and cleaner and
do not have the heaviness of the Bourne Shell.

Ad then a `make DESTDIR=/usr install' will install the essential initramfs
generating files into `/usr' prefix. One do not actually have to install to
make any use of the package. One can pretty mush use almost everything minus
the init service script which has to be installed of course.

To install the building scripts, a simple `make DESTDIR=/usr install_bash' or
`make DESTDIR=/usr install_zsh' is necessary. autogen, busybox, gnupg scripts
will not be in any use if not using Gentoo because I am not planing to adapt
them to any distribution out there. One just need static busybox and why not
gpg-1.4.x (for GnuPG support) binaries for that can be compiled with gnupg
and busybox scripts. One can get easily from binary distributions. So no
need to make any extra script for the latter case.

To make use of sqfsdmount for squashed diretory a 
`make sys_confdir=/etc install_svc' will be necessary. Aufs+Squashfs is
required here.

Any filesystem utility for mount+umount+fsck is virtually supported.
Just make sure to include the binaries and make symlink for mount, 
umount and fsck [.$fs] to the binaries. And everything will go as 
expected.

This initramfs generating tool support LUKS, LVM, [DM]RAID, splashes and
/etc/{msg,issue.logo} (msg for boot up message) and more.
