To install this package and actually make any use of it, you will just need
a static busybox. To make use of any building or utility script,
an additional shell, bash or zsh, is required. Zsh scripts are
shorter/cleaner and do not have the heaviness of the Bourne-Again SHell.

Ad then a `make DESTDIR=/usr install' will install the essential initramfs
files into `/usr' prefix. Installation is not required to make any use of
this package. Quite the contrary, one can pretty mush use almost everything
minus the init service script which has to be installed of course.

To install the building scripts, a simple `make DESTDIR=/usr install_bash' or
`make DESTDIR=/usr install_zsh' is necessary. autogen, busybox, gnupg scripts
will not be in any use if not using Gentoo because I am not planing to adapt
them to any distribution out there. One just need static busybox and a static
gpg-1.4.x (for GnuPG support) binaries which have an easy access from binary
distributions. So no need to make any extra script for the latter case.

To make use of squashdir-mount for squashed (AUFS+squashfs) diretor-y-ies a 
`make sys_confdir=/etc install_svc' will be necessary. AUFS+Squashfs
kernel modules are required here.

Any filesystem utility for mount+umount+fsck is virtually supported.
Just make sure to include the binaries and symlinks, if necessary,
for {mount,umount,fsck}.$fs. And everything will go as expected.
