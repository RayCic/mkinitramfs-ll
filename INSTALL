A `make prefix=/usr install' will install the essential initramfs files.
Installation is not required to make any use of this package. Quite the contrary,
one can pretty much use almost everything minus the init service scripts.

An easy `make prefix=/usr sysconfdir=/etc install-all' is available.

To install the building scripts, a simple `make prefix=/usr install-scripts-bash'
or `make prefix=/usr install-scripts-zsh' is necessary.

busybox, gnupg {ba,z}sh scripts will not be useful if not using Gentoo.
One just need a busybox and a static gpg-1.4 binary (for GnuPG support).
(Static binaries are prefered, at least for busybox and gpg.)

To make use of any init service script, just run the following with a service
name (zram/squashd) `make sysconfdir=/etc install-<name>-svc'.
  * squashdir init script require aufs+squashfs; and
  * tmpdir    init script require either tmpfs or zram+FileSystem module; and
  * zram      init script require zram kernel module.
Or else, `make sysconfdir=/etc install-services' instead is available.

Any filesystem utility for mount+umount+fsck is virtually supported.
Just make sure to include the binaries and symlinks, if necessary,
for {mount,umount,fsck}.$fs. And everything will go as expected.
