This where user extra files (binaries, man pages, info and scripts (to etc/local.d))
files are stored relatively from this dir,just like in @/usr@.

User scripts should have a prefix @{1,2{r,s},3{f,d,m},4{s,u}]}?-@ corresponding to 
a init runlevel and a `.sh' suffix to be correctly executed in the right run level.

*Note*: busybox (stored in bin) and its optional applets--@busybox.app@--in
etc/mkinitramfs-ll/ and @mdev.conf@ in etc/ are stored in this directory as well.
