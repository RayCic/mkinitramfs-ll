This where user extra files (binaries, man pages, info and scripts (to etc/local.d))
files are stored relatively from this dir,just like in @/usr@.

User scripts should have a prefix @{1,2{r,s},3{f,d,m,s},4{c,m,s,u}}?-@ corresponding to 
a init runlevel and a `.sh' suffix to be correctly executed in the right run level.

*Note*: [usr/bin/]busybox and its optional applets--@[usr/etc/mkinitramfs-ll/]busybox.app@--
and @[usr/etc/]mdev.conf@ are stored in this directory as well.
