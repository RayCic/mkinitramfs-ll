Binaries and extra files can be putted in this directory to facilitate building initramfs.
So this would limite file seeking and movings... like busybox and GnuPG related files.

* busybox:

- @usr/bin/busybox@ binary and its optional
- @usr/etc/mkinitramfs-ll/busybox.applets@ applet file (there is no need to have
  this file as it will be generated when building initramfs)
- @usr/etc/mdev.conf@ and mdev conf file are stored in this directory following
  the previous scheme mdev related scripts are in @usr/lib/mdev@

* GnuPG:

- @usr/bin/gpg@ binary and
- @usr/share/gnupg/options.skel@ file
are stored here following the previous scheme.
