This where extra man pages and info files are stored relatively from this dir,
jut like in @/usr@ without the @/usr@ prefix.

Extra user scripts are also stored with prefix @{1,2{r,s},3{f,d,m},4{s,u}]}?-@
corresponding to a init runlevel and a `.sh' suffix.

*Note*: @?@ is, of course, a single characters or digit.
