*New*: mkinitramfs-ll-0.12.8 support kernel module group loading, meaning:
one can append a group name instead of a module name like @imod=kms@

*Warn*: mkinitramfs-ll-0.12.8 user script changed previous sufix .$level
to prefix $level-! See user script section.

*Warn*: mkinitramfs-ll-0.12.0 or later require the associated usr directory.
There's no support building at hand without the associated generating scripts!

*New:* mkinitramfs-ll-0.12.0 allow to be dropped on each read() (infinite loop).
Just type @sh@ or @shell@ and then hit Enter.
