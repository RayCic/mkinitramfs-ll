0.14.3:

* Fix the annoying prefix slash '/' in squash dir related script
(the previous measure in 0.14.2 was not enough);
* Fix setting mode (if present in zram init script).

0.14.2:

* zfs version bump that require only *izfs* cmdline argument,
this hook as result will be executed if only if izfs is defined;
* allow only case insensitive +s|+sys|+system and +l|+local (short/long
options) to squashd();
* improved dmopen() to be sure to boot with variations of iraid;
* added an environment profile to be able to boot with an empty kernel cmdline.

0.14.1:

* fixed broken -F switch and removed redundant firmware bits;
* a bunch of usefull fixes and update, read the configure file and commits;
* added case insensitive rescue|rsh support in kernel command line;
* added kernel module group support in boot (imod already support that),
so one can make default module groups and add theme to boot group
(and then no need to append imod=something if not needed!);
* inproved shread(), now support case insensitive [r]sh|shell|rescue;
* fix issue when ro|rw and imopt=<something> are appended on cmdline;
* ability to copy kernel module dependencies for building scripts;
* cleaned up squashd() to have a nice and user friendly api, see README;
* added default font/keymap to building scripts, so init script can pick up
a font/keymap pair if *ikmap* kernel cmdline argument is not present.

0.14.0:

* clean up bcache hooks, now provide a simple and functional hooks;
* renamed (internal) module to hook which is more appropriate;
* fix mkinitramfs-ll.bash kernel module dealing (with *globbing everywhere*);
* file system position change for *iroot* (see README);
* version bumped zram hook/module (almost feature complete);
* version bumped functions to use fewer arg() calls (+efficiency);
* bumped version for init script that now use start|stop_pre() instead of
stuffing start() and stop();
* refined zram.initd which is now feature comple;
* fixed mkinitramfs-ll.{ba,z}sh (new) commands line switches (parsing).

0.13.7:

* added svc/zramdir.{conf,init}d, a service to take extra zram backed device
stuff to not stuff zram service script with numerous devices;
* clean up svc/* scripts and removed bashisms from service scripts;
* cmdline clean for bash/zsh scripts (there were many left overs...);
* now mkinitramfs-ll.bash will pick up opts[-<single-letter>] options found
in mkinitramfs-ll.conf (zsh variant always honored it);
* removed openrc and splash specific bits from sdr.$shell, new openrc has
runtime temporary files in /run, it think splash-utils is unmaintained...;
* now zsh scripts use getopt(1) to parse optional arguments, (zsh/zutil)
zparseopts is awfull for long options;
* mkinitramfs-ll.zsh: fix parsing -b|-bin,-F|-firmware,-y|-keymap, so next
occurences will rightly append options;
* fix help formating for bash scripts regarding white space issue (getopt(1)).

0.13.6:

* fix copying binaries which have busybox applets that end up by
corrupting/overriding busybox binary;
* synced to current mdev files (conf/lib);
* fix root mount option (broken with an old variable rename);
* fix busybox applets list generating with a dynamic binary;
* clean up: init/mkinitramfs-ll.zsh;
* now warning will be printed to stderr instead of stdout, so one can
easily get access to no fatal warnings with something like `2>err';
* added kernel compressor check and iterration loop to get a supported
compressed initramfs, so now one can build an uncompressed initramfs
as result when building with -c'none' switch;
* rewritten adn() to donod(), zsh has a fix with this;
* moved domod() from init lib/functions to make the function public;
* mkinitramfs-ll.$shell won't enforce a static busybox binary anymore,
only a warning will be displayed if a dynamic binary is found.

0.13.5:

* fix splash deamon initialization (broken because of helper renames, sigh);
* fix parsing zfs argument for sawap and resume along with the returned device.

0.13.4:

* fix key mode for zfs module;
* fix kernel cmdline argument parsing for zfs.

0.13.3:

* documented *imodule* kernel cmdline;
* cleaned usr/README;
* finished reverting commit dd17c24.

0.13.2:

* revert commit dd17c24 7a9d1fe b601b48 dd17c24 that introduced function name()
definition to sh scripts;
* added user_xattr to zram.initd;
* updated {,svc/}README busybox related bits;
* minor fix for init (umount proc at the end, not at the begining).

0.13.1:

* fix copying binaries and libraries: binaries and libraries are no longer
duplicated, symlinks are copied instead with the libraries;
* renamed sqfsd to squashd in init,usr/lib/mkinitramfs-ll/functions,
mkinitramfs-ll.{conf,{ba,z}sh};
* init/sdr.$shell/squashdir-mount.initd use standard .squashfs file extension;
* added initialization code for sdr.$shell and squashdir-mount;
* renamed clumsy sqfsdmount name to a more clear squashdir-mount;
* clean up sdr.$shell and squashdir-mount with more clear/understandable names
for functions/variables;
* sdr.$shell use `lzo -Xcompression-level 1' as default compressor for speed
and efficiency; hdd or ssd space is cheap nowadays;
* updated squashdir/SQUASHDIR=/aufs (default squash-ed root location);
* update help message because option should append just after option string
* added -F|[-]-firmware switch to mikinitramfs-ll

0.13.0:

* added *imdodule* kernel cmdline argument to be able to execute scripts
or mmodule whenever one want to do so, previous implementation ran the
script or module on every single boot up: now append e.g *imodule=zram*
is enough! And do not prefix scripts/module with LVL init run level which
brings the old behavious. See zram and zfs for pratical exemples.
Actualy nobody would want to append zram to *imodule* because zram module
will be executed if *izram* kernel cmdline is appended.
* added resume/swap support for zfs.
* now append *-Mzfs* is enough to include kernel modules/module/binaries.

0.12.8:

* added zram support, now one can get zram devices as early as possible.
* support kernel module group loading, meaning:
one can append a group name instead of a module name like *imod=kms*;
* user script changed previous sufix *.$level* to prefix *$level-*!
See user script section.
* renamed clumsy ishrl to irsh kernel cmdline argument.
* now one can type SH|SHELL|RSH on each read as well!
* autogen.{ba,z}sh: deleted useless files.
* removed -W|-workdir useless switch from scripts, now initramfs
will be build from TMPDIR:-/tmp.
* now bash scripts accept -? switch for help;
* rename -u|[-]-usage for standard -h|[-]-help switch.
* removed useless -v|[-]-version switch, version string is printed
with -h|[-]-help.
* now squashed dir works with full path e.g. /var/lib/layman:/var/portage or
with var/lib/layman:var/portage which was previously required before 0.12.8.

0.12.0:

* since this version: require the associated usr directory.
There's no support building at hand without the associated generating scripts!

* allow to be dropped in rescue shell on each read() (infinite loop):
just type @sh@ or @shell@ and then hit Enter.

0.8.2:

* now one can *exit* the rescue shell after beiing dropped there,
or simply after a @rescue[shell]/RSH[ELL]@ or @irsh=<n>@ on kernel
cmdline and the init will resume booting from there.
