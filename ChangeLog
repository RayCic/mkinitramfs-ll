0.12.8:

* added zram support, now one can get zram devices as early as possible.
* support kernel module group loading, meaning:
one can append a group name instead of a module name like *imod=kms*;
* user script changed previous sufix *.$level* to prefix *$level-*!
See user script section.
* renamed clumsy ishrl to irsh kernel cmdline argument.
* now one can type SH|SHELL|RSH on each read as well!
* autogen.{ba,z}sh: deleted useless files.
* removed -W|-workdir useless switch from scripts, now initramfs
will be build from TMPDIR:-/tmp.
* now bash scripts accept -? switch for help;
* rename -u|[-]-usage for standard -h|[-]-help switch.
* removed useless -v|[-]-version switch, version string is printed
with -h|[-]-help.
* now squashed dir works with full path e.g. /var/lib/layman:/var/portage or
with var/lib/layman:var/portage which was previously required before 0.12.8.

0.12.0:

* since this version: require the associated usr directory.
There's no support building at hand without the associated generating scripts!

* allow to be dropped in rescue shell on each read() (infinite loop):
just type @sh@ or @shell@ and then hit Enter.

0.8.2:

* now one can *exit* the rescue shell after beiing dropped there,
or simply after a @rescue[shell]/RSH[ELL]@ or @irsh=<n>@ on kernel
cmdline and the init will resume booting from there.
