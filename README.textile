bq. "an initramfs with *optional RAID (dmraid/mdadm), DM-Crypt LUKS, LVM,
TuxOnIce, AUFS+squashfs, ZFS, zram support; and maybe much more; and
with a handfull zsh and bash set of scripts to get going easily and quickly."

*WARNING: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! EVERYTHING IS GIVEN "AS IS", SEE COPYRIGHT FILE*

h3. 1. Getting an intramfs quickly and ready

If you have a static busybox binary or if you use Gentoo
[you have already one: installed as /bin/bb],
you can make an initramfs in matter of secondes with locales settings:
keymap and consolefont, in addition to media-fonts/terminus-font if you use
the associated "ebuild":https://github.com/tokiclover/bar-overlay,
or if you have that package installed).

If you want GnuPG support, yo should have an app-crypt/gnupg-1.4*[static]
binary along with its options.skel file.
Or if you run Gentoo you can run either gnupg.{ba,z}sh to generate one. 

@gnupg.zsh -W/usr/share/mkinitramfs-ll@ if you installed the package
or simply @gnupg.zsh@ will build a binary in the current directory
(with a usr/bin/gpg and usr/share/gnupg/options.skel).
Or else, run the bash script counterpart to get build a binary.

And then run @mkinitramfs-ll.zsh -font -keymap -gpg@
or the bash counterpart @mkinitramfs-ll.bash --font --keymap --gpg@
to generate an initramfs.

Gentoo users can build everything with: @autogen.zsh -all -font -keymap@
or bash counterpart @autogen.bash --all --font --keymap@

Of course, one can append extra fonts and keymaps with @-fter-g12n -yfr-latin1@
etc. and the @-a@ option depend on @mkinitramfs-ll.conf@
so one can put many sane default values there.

One can get more info on the scripts by running @$script -u@

h3. 2.1 _Optional_ kernel cmdline option or arguments

*_Only_* @iroot@ _is required_ else nothing will happen but a kernel panic. 
And of course, when using this script, one does not need @root=<arg>@
nor @resume=<arg>@ kernel command line options.

KERNEL-COMMAND-LINE-ARG: @iroot=<PV|VG-LV>[:c:<fs>]@
DESCRIPTION: root block device, required,
	recommanded optional file system check @:[c|chk|y|..]:[<filesystem>]@
EXAMPLE: @iroot=vg-root:c:ext4@ for an ext4 rootfs in LVM (Volume Group is named vg),
	or @iroot=POOL/root::zfs@ for zfs rootfs in a zfs pool called POOL.

*Note*: @:[n*|N*]:@ instead of @[c*|y*|Y*:]@
will disable a die after fsck failure.

KERNEL-COMMAND-LINE-ARG: @imopt=<ro,inode64,...>@
DESCRIPTION: optional rootfs mount options
EXAMPLE: @imopt=inode64,noatime,ro@ for xfs file system@

KERNEL-COMMAND-LINE-ARG: @imount=</usr:/var:...>@
DESCRIPTION: mount /usr:/var using the included @/etc/fstab@
EXAMPLE: @imount=/usr@

*Note*: @imount@ can be used to mount /usr:/var ... using @/etc/fstab@.
Nothing more is required if using unencrypted volume. 
However, if using LVM and/or LUKS and/or RAID array, one should make sure
that the underlaying volume are available before level @4m@.

KERNEL-COMMAND-LINE-ARG: @imod=<uvesafb:kms:...>@
DESCRIPTION: optional modules to load (in the boot group)
EXAMPLE: @imod=kms:uvesafb@
EXAMPLE: if using the building scripts one can append @imod=kms@ for basic 
kms related drivers group (one can append extra modules to opts[-mkms] in 
mkinitramfs-ll.conf if need b).

KERNEL-COMMAND-LINE-ARG: @ikmap=<kmap>[:<font>]@
DESCRIPTION: optional keymap and font to load, handy for passwords
EXAMPLE: @ikmap=fr-x86_64.bin:ter-g12n.psf@

KERNEL-COMMAND-LINE-ARG: @irsh=<n>|:<m>@
DESCRIPTION: interrupt init and drop to a Rescue SHell (@<n>@ level);
or pass @<m>@ run level to real init if present
EXAMPLE: @irsh=3s@ drop to @3s@ (before squahsd()) init level,
	or @irsh=:1@ pass @1@, so single to real init

KERNEL-COMMAND-LINE-ARG: @rescue|rescueshell|RSH|RSHELL@
DESCRIPTION: drops directly into a minimal shell
EXAMPLE: RSH

*Note*: one can exit a rescue shell and then resume booting !
Type in _exit_ and hit _Enter_

KERNEL-COMMAND-LINE-ARG: @ilvm=<map-PV>,...,<map-PV>@
DESCRIPTION: LVM argument @<mapping-PV>@ is collon ':' separated list of PVs of
a Volume Group; and comma ',' separated list of VG: 1st for root, 2nd for swap
and the 3rd for resume. Hence one can append commas to asign a particular group.
EXAMPLE: @lvm=pva-sda1:pvb-sdb1,pvc-sda1@ assigne a single PV to swap group,
	and two PVs to root group with its mappings.

*Note*: This argument is used only in case of dm-crypt LUKS crypted PVs.
Unencrypted PVs do _not_ require this!
Asingle character or word is sufficient in that case.

KERNEL-COMMAND-LINE-ARG: @iraid=<array>+UUID=<uuid>[|<p>|<f>]@
DESCRIPTION: comma separated list of arrays for root, swap and resume
EXAMPLE:

KERNEL-COMMAND-LINE-ARG: @iswap=<type>:<VG-LV>[:signature]@
DESCRIPTION: the equivalent of @iroot@ for swap
EXAMPLE: e.g. @iswap=swap:sda2@ for an unencrypted swap device

KERNEL-COMMAND-LINE-ARG: @iresume=<type>:<VG-LV>[:signature]@
DESCRIPTION: the equivalent of @iroot@ for resume, to resume from the already
swap passed in the command line, one need only a @iresume=swap@ cmdline.
EXAMPLE: e.g. @iresume=file:<VG-LV>[:<signature>]@ for a swapfile in a Logical Volume

KERNEL-COMMAND-LINE-ARG: @ikroot=<mode>:<device>:</path/to/file>@
DESCRIPTION: key [file] mode for @iroot@ group
EXAMPLE: @ikroot=gpg:sdc1:/key.gpg@ for a GnuPG crypted key file in sdc1

KERNEL-COMMAND-LINE-ARG: @ikswap=<mode>:<device>:</path/to/file>@
DESCRIPTION: key [file] mode for @iswap@ group
EXAMPLE: @iswap=reg:sdb1:/key.reg@ for a regular key file in root of sdb1

KERNEL-COMMAND-LINE-ARG: @ikresume=<mode>:<device>:</path/to/key/file>@
DESCRIPTION: key [file] mode for @iresume@ group
EXAMPLE: @ikresume=pwd@ for a password mode

KERNEL-COMMAND-LINE-ARG: @isqfsd=y[|/sqfsdir],y[|[n|a]:<dir>]@
DESCRIPTION: squashed directories, see below for more info
EXAMPLE: @isqfsd=y,a:lib64@ use default squashed dirs and append @/lib64@

KERNEL-COMMAND-LINE-ARG: @idebug=<x:...>[,<log_level>]@
DESCRIPTION: optionaly enable a colon separated list of sh (set) option,
like shell tracing etc.; and otptional dmesg console log level
EXAMPLE: @idebug=x@ enable shell tracing
EXAMPLE: @idebug=x:e,debug@ enable shell tracing, export every assigned variable
and set debug console log level

init script accept also @single@, @ro@, @rw@ and @init=/path/to/real/init@
kernel cmdline argument and will append single runlevel to real init. 

It also support @splash=silent,fadein,theme:emergence console=[/dev/]tty1@
or @splash=silent,fadein,theme:emergenc,tty:1@ esplash kernel cmdline arguments.

h3. 2.2 About mount options: @imopt=<rootfs mount options>@

Say, you have a @rootfs=xfs[|jsf|reiser|ext*]@ and want to mount your rootfs
with specific opts. In case of xfs, for exemple, just create your log volume
on a different volume than what you're logging from and everything is set up--
well if the logging volume is in the swap group--and, in fact, you do 
not need a swap volume there--you just use that group as if there were one. 

h3. 3.1 DM-Crypt LUKS supported key[-file] modes

For volume that are encrypted with a key, setting @ikroot@ and/or @ikswap@
and/or @ikresume@ is required, otherwise a passphrase is required for _each_
physical volume as a fall back.

* @<mode>@: defines how the init script shall treat the supplied key:

** @gpg@: key-file is GnuPG encrypted file
** @ldk@: key-file is LUKS encrypted, via loop back device
** @reg@: key-file is a regular file
** @pwd@: encrypted on a regular passphrase
** @none@: handy for unencrypted volumes

* @<device|dev>@ is a block device that will be assigned to the removable media
* @</path/to/file>@ is a full path to file inside the removable media

h3. 3.2. Notes on DM-Crypt LUKS key modes

* @gpg@: GnuPG encrypted key-file support only gnupg-1.4*,
	used as @gpg -qd /path/to/keyfile |@. One can add a @/root/.gnupg/gpg.conf@
	in the initramfs root to avoid its creattion on each boot, a simple file
	is already included in the package
* @ldk@: encrypted key-file passed to cryptsetup as
	@-d /dev/mapper/$(basename /path/to/keyfile)@ after decryption 
* @reg@: regular keyfile passed to cryptsetup as @-d /path/to/keyfile@
* @pwd@: regular passphrase: it's mandatory to append any
	@ikroot[|swap|resume]=pwd@ (fallback keymode for crypted devices)
* @none@: unencrypted block device, it's not mandatory to append this
	key mode: this the default (v0.12.0)
	
h3. 3.3. About device @/dev/@ prefix and detached DM-Crypt LUKS header

There's no need to provide any @/dev/@ prefix for block devices,
blk() will take care of it.
Now one can use @UUID=<uuid>@ or @LABEL=<label>@ instead of 
@[/dev/]sd[a-z0-9]@ for any block device or physical volume. 
However, a leading plus @+@ is used as a separator for
detached header device|file when using dm-crypt LUKS:
@<map-UUID=<uid>[+UUID=<uuid>|</path/to/header/file>]@

Each encrypted PV, with a detached header is given like:

* @<sda+sdc>@ for a detached header to @/dev/sdc@ device
	passed as @--header /dev/sdc@ to dmopen().
* @<sda+/path/to/header/file>@ for a detached header file 
	passed as @--header /mnt/tok/path/to/header/file@ to dmopen().

*Note*: So in this case, the header file must be in the same removable device
or @/boot@ volume used for key-files.
Because it'll be too troublesome to make it otherwise.

*Warning*: Of course, a detached header to a device should use an UUID or a LABEL
instead of to a block device @sd[a-z0-9]@ to avoid header mismatch!

h3. 4.1. RAID array support

@iraid@ argument can take up to 3 comma separated list of RAID arrays:
the 1st for root, 2nd for swap and the 3rd for resume.
Each argument is of the forme @<array>+UUID=<uuid>[|<part>|<format>]@.
@<format>@ is a metadata format used to scan dmraid set and subset
software (ata)raid and @<part>@ a partiton number.

Either way, one can use mdadm software raid like @iraid=md<n>+UUID=<uuid>@
and optionaly embed or not an config file @/etc/mdadm.conf@.
Either way @iraid@ is sufficient to enable arrays: 

@echo ARRAY <array> <uuid> >> /etc/mdadm.conf@,
or else, @iraid=md<n>+<part>@ to enable arrays like:
@echo ARRAY <array> devices=/dev/sd*<part> >> /etc/mdadm.conf@,
@<part>@ could be something like @[a-d]2@.

Or else, an optional @<format>@ can be used to enable mdraid software (ata)raid
e.g. @asr|..|isw|jmicron|..|dos@ see @mdraid -l@. dmraid software raid can be
passed like @iraid=<array>+isw:dos@, ':' as a metadata seperator.

*Note*: raid array can be used as the underlaying pyshical device of unencrypted
or encrypted with LVM on top.
@<UUID=<uuid>>@ or @<part>@ is required to enable mdadm software raid, nothing or
@<format>@ can be used to enable dmraid sofware (ata)raid.

h3. 4.2. LVM support

Actually a PV in a group, respectively root, swap, resume is given by
@<mapping>-<device>@, mapping being a mapping name for cryptsetup and
a block device/volume without the optional @/dev/@ prefix.

* LV, PV, VG: Logical Volume, Physical Volume, Volume Group.
* @map-PV@: is a colon separated list @<mapping-PV>@ e.g. @<pv1-sda1:pv2-sdb1:...>@
for a Volume Group, the 1st being for root, the 2nd for swap and the 3rd for resume;
so this @ilvm=,swp-sdc1,@ asign only a LV for swap.

*NOTE*: for unencrypted PVs, there's no need to provide a list of PVs in @ilvm@ arg.
A single character or word is enough to activate LVM like @ilvm=y@ for root.

* PV list: now @<map-PV>@ [list] can be replaced with @</path/to/list>@ file,
this require the use of keyfile to decrypt PV, which means that a removable media
or @/boot@ device is mounted. 
List can be a line separated list insted of a collon @:@ of the forme:
@<mapping-UUID=<uid>[+UUID=<uuid>]@ for an UUID list.
One can mix UUID, LABEL and [h|s]d??* in a list. However, it's best to use UUID
only for detached header from cyphertext device which prevent header mismatch.
One can use multiple lists up to three, one for each group.

h3. 4.3 Squashed (AUFS+squashfs) directories support

One can use squashfs+aufs to squash directories like @$PORTDIR:var/lib/layamn@,
or system related directories like @usr:lib32:lib64:bin:sbin@. Advantages are
system speed, responsiveness and very small disk size footprint.

Squashed directories argument:

* @isqfsd=y[|/sqfsdir],y[|[n|a]:<dir1>:<dirn>]@
	using default or append directories after a @[n|a]:@
* @isqfsd=/sqfsdir,n:<dir 1>:<dir n>@
	neither sqfsdir nor sqfsd default is used, sqfsdir,sqfsd required
* @isqfsd=y,y@
	using sqfsd and sqfsdir default values do not require any additional argument. 
* @isqfsd=y,a:<dir 1>[:<dir n>]@
	same as above, however, @<dir 1>[:<dir n>]@ is  appended to sqfsd variable.

h3. 4.4. Optional user scripts support

Now one can add scripts to @modules/@ directory, or else directly in
@$gitdir/usr/lib/mkinitramfs-ll@ if using mkinitramfs-ll.$shell generating script.
Basically, each script is considered to be a module! So one can append -M$script
to mkinitramfs-ll.$shell; and if there is a opts[-m$script] kernel module group
line in mkinitramfs-ll.conf, the modules and module group will be added!

Each script  should have a @$level-@ prefix as the follwing $level values:
* runlevel 1:  initialization - splash - keymap - font - print boot msg - @1@
* runlevel 2?: @2s@ - swap - @2r@ - resume - rootfs -
* runlevel 3?: @3d@ - decrypt - @3f@ - rootfs fsck - @3m@ - root mount -
* runlevel 4?: @4c@ - clean up - @4m@ - mount /usr:/var... - @4u@ -
	umount - @4s@ - switch root

*Info*: See zfs/zram module for more info and a praticable examples.

h3. 4.5. ZFS support

KERNEL-COMMAND-LINE-ARG: @izfs=zva-sda:zvb-sdb@
DESCRIPTION: Required argument for crypted zfs vdev (devices)
EXEMPLE: read the following

One can use something like @iroot=POOL/ROOT[::zfs][ izfs=zva-sda:zvb-sdb]@.
Notice that @izfs@ argument is required for crypted vdev(s). Do not forget to
include zfs module or build an initramfs with something like:
@mkinitramfs-ll.$shell -a -f -y -Mzfs -b:zpool:zfs@
(kernel modules would be rightly added).

*IMPORTANT*: So either way one can append @::zfs@ to @iroot@ argument for
[un]encrypted vdev(s) or @:zfs@ to @iswap@ or to @iresume@;
or either, @izfs@ will suffice for encrypted vdev(s) or else both for this case.

h3. 4.6. ZRAM support

To get a simple zram support in order to get zram device as early as possible,
one need only to append @zram@ kernel module to @imod@ argument and optionaly
zram.num_devices=<int> kernel command line argument.
Extra actions can be taken care with a _user script_ if needed.

Enter zram module. 

KERNEL-COMMAND-LIE-ARG: @izram=4,4G:ext3@
DESCRIPTION: zram basic initialisation kernel command line argument
EXEMPLE: see above

This module/script take care of basic zram initialisation:
* First integer: passed as num_devices=<int> to modprobe;
* Following arguments are pair of size:filesystem: just make sure to include
mkfs.$fs binaries!

Just appand -M:zram to mkinitramfs-ll.$shell to get support for this module.

h3. 5. Kernel parameters example

DESCRIPTION: unencrypted Root LV
EXAMPLE: @iroot=vgr-lvr ilvm=y ikroot=none ikmap=fr-latin1-i686.bin:ter-g12n.psf@

*Note*: one can append any character or word like @ilvm=lvr@
when using LVM on unencrypted PVs.

DESCRIPTION: Root--regular passphrase--and fbsplash
EXAMPLE: @iroot=root-sda3 video=1280x800-24 imod=drm:drm_kms_helper:ttm:i915 
	ikroot=pwd splash=verbose,theme:livecd-20007.0,tty:1@

DESCRIPTION: Root--regular key-file--on usb device
EXAMPLE: @iroot=root-sda3 ikroot=reg:sdb1:/path/to/keyfile@

DESCRIPTION: Root--gpg encrypted key-file on usb drive
EXAMPLE: @iroot=sda3 ikroot=gpg:sdb1:/path/to/file@

DESCRIPTION: Swap and root--ldk encrypted--key-files
EXAMPLE: @iroot=root-sda3 iswap=swap[|file]:data-sda2[:signature] 
	ikroot=ldk:sdb1:/path/to/rootkey ikswap=ldk:sdb1:/path/to/swapkey@

DESCRIPTION: Regular swap _and_ TuxOnIce resume on a different volume
EXAMPLE: @iswap=swap-sda2 iresume=toi-sda3:0x4400 ikswap=pwd ikresume=pwd@

DESCRIPTION: Swap file--resuming from hibernation--ldk protected key-file
EXAMPLE: @iswap=file:swap-sda3:0x4400 iresume=toi[|CHAR|WORD] 
	ikswap=ldk:sdb1:/path/to/swapkey@

DESCRIPTION: crypted volume [root,swap] using LVM--ldk crypted keyfile and--
_and_ mount options for rootfs
EXAMPLE: @iroot=vgr-lvr:c:xfs iswap=file:vgs-lvs:0x4400 
	imopt=logdev=/dev/mapper/vgs-lvl,inode64,barrier 
	ilvm=pva1-UUID=uuida:pvb2-UUID=uuidb,pvc1-UID=uuidc 
	ikroot=ldk:LABEL=PENDRIVE:/path/to/keyfile 
	ikswap=ldk:LABEL=PENDRIVE:/path/to/keyfile@

*NOTE*: multiple key-files (one for each group) are supported along with single
a key file. 

h3. 6. Kernel module groups

To load kernel modules, one could either create needed groups in
mknitramfs-ll.conf as the kms kernel module group example.
Afterwards, one only need to append generaed groups as @imod=kms@ instead of
append a long list of modules like @imod=

Supported groups:

* @boot@: boot up modules, loaded but not removed
* @dm-crypt@: automaticaly generated with mkinitramfs-ll.$shell (dm-crypt module group)
* @devide-mapper@: automaticaly generated included script (device-mapper module group)
* @dm-raid@: automaticaly generated with included script (dmraid module group)
* @raid@: automaticaly generated with mkinitramfs-ll.$shell (mdadm/raid module group)
* @tuxonice@: tuxonice module, wich aren't removed
* @remdev@: modules required to access removable device
* @gpg@: modules required to access gpg crypted key-file
* @sqfsd@: modules required for squashfs+aufs, can be built into the kernel

Modules should exist in @/lib/modules/$KV/@, the kernel should support modules
[un]loading. Just make sure to append the necessary modules to the right group
in mkinitramfs-ll.conf for autoloading, or create your own groups, or else append
kernel modules to @opts[-mdep]@ variable to be able to append kernel mdoules to
@imod=@ kernel cmdline argument.
